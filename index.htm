            <h1 class="caption">Daniel Anyebe</h1><br> Hi Welcome.<br>
<br>I am pursuing a PhD in Economics & Finance at Poznań University of Life Sciences. I expect to graduate in November, 2025.<br>

<br>My research focuses on behavioural and experimental economics, decision-making, and entrepreneurship. My research provides deeper insights into risk, human behaviour, and strategic decision-making. Key areas investigates how cognitive biases such as anchoring, mental accounting, and the framing effect, along with risk perception, trust, game theory, and real options, shape entrepreneurial decision making and strategies to improve business outcomes.

                  <p class="small">
                    This paper presents an integrated mathematical model for the evaluation of public-private partnership (PPP) projects, taking into account uncertainty, anchoring bias, and potential competition that may affect such investments. Before committing to a PPP project, private firms must carefully consider public opinion, as well as manage the uncertainty and possible competitive dynamics that may arise in the future. Anchoring bias is a cognitive bias in which investors have trust in a particular piece of market information, known as the anchor, when forming their investment decisions. Specifically, the paper combines the real options approach with game theory to account for competition and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to capture the impact of market information disclosure. The result is an integrated model that serves as a decision-making tool for evaluating investments in PPP projects.

                        <p class="small"> This study aims to systematically review the key characteristics and issues in Corporate Social Responsibility among Small and Medium Enterprises (CSRS) research. The Systematic Assessment Quantitative Technique (SQAT) developed by Australian researchers, Catherine Pickering and Jason Antony Byrne, was used to identify and analyse 62 peer-reviewed CSRS articles from six high quality academic databases. Most of the studies took place in Europe and Asia while South America has been largely ignored. A significant number of CSRS research were empirical in nature, meaning that there is a need for more conceptual studies to aid the understanding of new CSRS norms and underlying factors. Additionally, CSRS articles focused mainly on identifying the various ways SMEs are implementing CSR. Finally, most CSRS articles adopted a single research method, with survey being the most dominant method. There is a need for future studies to combine a variety of methods so as to gain additional insight into CSRS related issues.

                        <p class="small"> This study examines how trust influences entrepreneurial intentions among students through a behavioural economics lens. In Nigeria’s uncertain environment, shaped by ethnic diversity and insurgency, trust is crucial for economic exchange and new ventures. Drawing on Akerlof and Shiller’s (2010) animal spirits, the study explores whether higher trust levels increase the willingness to start a business, offering insights into the behavioural drivers of entrepreneurship and the importance of cultivating a trust culture in emerging economies.

                        <p class="small"> This study examines how perceived behavioural control (PBC) interacts with socio-economic environments to shape entrepreneurial intention (EI) through the lens of behavioural decision-making. Using SEM, results show PBC strongly predicts EI, while environmental factors such as resource scarcity and social constraints influence choices via context-dependent heuristics and cognitive evaluations. Findings emphasize the behavioural mechanisms driving entrepreneurial action and the critical role of socio-economic context in shaping opportunity perception and risk assessment. </p>

					   <p class="small"> This study employs a behavioural economics framework to examine how financial framing influences entrepreneurial behaviour in a student population. Using mixed-effects models incorporating gain and loss scenarios, the results show that framing significantly shapes risk preferences consistent with prospect theory—participants were risk-averse under gains and risk-seeking under losses. However, these shifts in financial risk-taking did not strengthen entrepreneurial intentions. The findings indicate that risk-taking and entrepreneurship are behaviourally distinct, suggesting that financial framing alone cannot account for entrepreneurial engagement. Instead, stability motives and contextual constraints exert greater influence on decision-making. The study contributes to the behavioural economics of entrepreneurship by identifying the limits of gain framing as a motivational mechanism and highlighting the need for interventions that address both structural barriers and cognitive biases to foster opportunity-driven entrepreneurship.
